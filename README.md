🏡 Dragon Real Estate - Price Predictor

This project is a machine learning-based housing price prediction model using the Boston Housing Dataset. It demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow—from data exploration to model training and evaluation—built with Python and libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

📌 Features

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

-Data preprocessing (missing values, feature engineering, etc.)

-Train-test split using train_test_split

-Model building using Linear Regression

-Performance evaluation with metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE)

-Model persistence using joblib

📁 Dataset

-The model uses a cleaned version of the Boston Housing dataset (data.csv), which contains features like:

  -CRIM (crime rate)

  -RM (average number of rooms)

  -LSTAT (lower status population %)

  -PTRATIO (pupil-teacher ratio)

  and more...

📊 Libraries Used

-Pandas

-NumPy

-Matplotlib

-Seaborn

-Scikit-learn

-Joblib
